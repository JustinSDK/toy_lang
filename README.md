# Toy Lang

Toy lang was started from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/JustinSDK/9c38136b90137387ad3518d4e99d15ba). It's the first language I made and might be a prototype if you want to design your own language. The following examples contain several syntaxes of Toy lang. ES6 modules support is required.
